        <h2>Chapter 8: Forms</h2>
        <p>Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page. When a form was submitted, it would be sent to a server where the 
            information would be processed using a 'back end' language such as PHP or Ruby. It’s possible, and becoming more and more common, 
            to process the information in a form on the 'front end' before it is sent to the server using JavaScript. A useful technique that 
            can aid usability is to disable the submit button if there are errors on the form. If the submit button is disabled then no action 
            is taken when it’s clicked. Most browsers will also display it in a lighter color to indicate that it cannot be clicked on. This 
            prevents users from submitting a form containing any errors.

        <h2>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. 
            The objects can also be reused or easily modified, as required. In JS, Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables 
            using const and defining a function inside a constructor function. These can be made public using getter and setter functions. Monkey-patching 
            is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. This should be done with caution as it can cause unexpected 
            behavior in the way built-in objects work.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 15: Modern JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve. jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large 
            number of useful and well-tested functions. Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified and compressed. 
            The script tag should be placed just before the closing </body> tag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Does ‘placeholder’ have a max length? Basically will the width/height of an input box wrap/expand to how long a placeholder is?</li>
            <li>For the reading under Form Validation, it says it is very easy to bypass the front-end completely and send arbitrary data to the application's 
                backend. I might be the one not understanding this perfectly, but how can one bypass, let’s say, an input requiring an email?</li>
            <li>Is it correct to say that OOP is basically the good use of functions and classes?</li>
        </ul>
