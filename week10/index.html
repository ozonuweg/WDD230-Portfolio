        <h2>Client-side form validation</h2>
        <p>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. 
            This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form 
            controls. This article leads you through basic concepts and examples of client-side form validation.
            There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll encounter on the web:<br>
            <strong>* Built-in form validation</strong> uses HTML5 form validation features, which we've discussed in many places throughout this module. 
            This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.<br>
            <strong>* JavaScript validation</strong> is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).
        </p><br>

        <h2>Using Fetch</h2>
        <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that 
            provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network. The Fetch API provides the fetch() method defined on a window object. This is used to perform requests. 
            This method returns a Promise which can be further used to retrieve response of the request. 
            A basic fetch request is really simple to set up. For example:
            <code>fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')<br>
                .then(response => response.json())<br>
                .then(data => console.log(data));</code>
        </p><br>


        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Can one by-pass client-side form validation?</li>
            <li>How do we utilize fetch for unsupported browsers?</li>
            <li>Are there other ways to make server requests and load information aside fetch?</li>
        </ul>
