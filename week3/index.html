        <h2>Object Methods: This</h2>
        <p>Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties. A function that is a property of an object is called its method. 
            When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”. To access 
            the object, a method can use the this keyword. The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method. In 
            JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a 
            method of an object.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 5: Objects</h2>
        <p>Everything in JavaScript is either one of the six primitive data types: strings, numbers, booleans, symbols, undefined, and null 
            or an object. An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. One way to think about an object 
            is that it’s like a dictionary where you look up a property name and see a value. It's like a database of values (in fact, some 
            databases use JavaScript objects to store information). Properties and methods can be changed or removed, and new properties 
            and methods can be added to the object, even if it was declared using const. Objects are assigned by reference. This means that 
            if a variable is assigned to an object that already exists, it will simply point to the exact same space in memory. So any 
            changes made using either reference will affect the same object. Namespacing is good because it avoids clashes with other functions.

        <h2>Chapter 6: The Document Object Model</h2>
        <p>The Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes. The document.getElementById(), 
            document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can be used to 
            access elements on a page. The parentNode(), previousSibling(), nextSibling(), childNodes() and children() methods 
            can be used to navigate around the DOM tree. An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, 
            and updated using the setAttribute() method. The createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create 
            dynamic markup on the fly. Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and insertBefore() methods. 
            Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild() method, and removed using the removeChild() method. The innerHTMLproperty 
            can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM. The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the styleproperty.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 7: Events</h2>
        <p>DOM is an interface that allows you to use JavaScript to interact with a web page. Events are another part of the DOM and they are what 
            provides the link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, 
            pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to. Event listeners are like setting a 
            notification to alert you when something happens. Instead of the program having to constantly check to see if an event has occurred, 
            the event listener will let it know when the event happens, and the program can then respond appropriately. This allows the program 
            to continue with other tasks while it waits for the event to happen. Whenever an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback 
            function is called. This function is automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains information about the event.

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I’m still unclear of how “this” value depends on the context at runtime.</li>
            <li>How complex can a nested object get?</li>
            <li>Is JSON the only data storage that’s compatible with JavaScript? If no, is JSON just the preferred?</li>
            <li>Are there any pros of using DOM over regular HTML and CSS?</li>
            <li>What other cases or examples of stopping default behavior are there (aside broken links)?</li>
        </ul>
