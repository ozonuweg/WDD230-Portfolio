        <h2>Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h2>
        <p>“Well-commented code is the hallmark of a ninja programmer”. Comments makes its easier for someone to read and understand your code. 
            A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces. The six primitive datatype in JavaScript include: 
            String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined, and Null. All non-primitive data types return a type of 'object'. Constant and variable 
            names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, _ , or dollar character, $ . They can also contain numbers, but 
            cannot start with them.  NaN is an error value that is short for "Not a Number". It is used when an operation is attempted and the 
            result isn’t numerical, like if you try to multiply a string by a number.

        <h2>Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
        <p>
            Each item in an array can be treated like a variable. You can change the value using the assignment operator =. An array can contain a 
            variety of different data types. Even when an array’s value is deleted, the array still has the same number of elements, and the position 
            can still be referenced as an index, but it will just return undefined. The length property for an array is mutable, meaning you can manually 
            change it. The concat() method can be used to merge an array with one or more arrays. The join() method can be used to turn the array into a 
            string that comprises all the items in the array, separated by commas. The switch operator can be used to make your code easier to follow when 
            there are lots of conditions to test.

        <h2>Chapter 4: Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions help reduce repetition and make code easier to follow.
            To define a function literal we can use a function declaration:
        </p>
        <code>
            function hello() {<br>
                console.log('Hello World!');<br>
            }
        </code>
        <p>
            Don’t Repeat Yourself, or DRY, is a principle of programming that specifies that every part of a program should only be written once. This 
            avoids duplication and means there’s no need to keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.
