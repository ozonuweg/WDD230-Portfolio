        <h2>Master Mobile UX video on Sitepoint</h2>
        It was the best 32 minutes I've ever spent. The highlight for me was reducing 5 steps of removing expired 
        boarding passes to 0 steps beacuse it should remove automatically. I appreciated the tips on having faster, easier 
        mobile apps. Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/cert/7ca44564c472cef6" target=”_blank”>Certificate of Completion</a> for the course.<br><br>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on the Master Mobile UX video, are we creating a mobile app for this class?</li>
            <li>What's the difference between cookies and local storage?</li>
            <li>How safe is local storage for people's data?</li>
        </ul>
