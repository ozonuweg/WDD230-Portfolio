        <h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by:<br>
            * System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.<br>
            * Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.<br>
            * User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.<br><br>
            An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. An exception will also produce astack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence. A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.
            JavaScript failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down. Placing'use strict'at the beginning of a file will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the file.</p><br>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In using HTML and JavaScript, is it possible to actually have errors and still have the program run? For example, I’ve had cases in my code where I’m missing a closing tag, etc, and it does work.</li>
            <li>Is it recommended to use strict mode in every JavaScript code we write?</li>
            <li>Do you have a recommended process for debugging?</li>
        </ul>
