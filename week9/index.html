        <h2>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h2>
        <p>In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page. 
            Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the global object is the window object. 
            This means that any global variable created is actually a property of the window object. In general, you should refer to global 
            variables without using the window object; it’s less typing and your code will be more portable between environments. An exception 
            is if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined. Some functions we’ve already met, such as parseInt() and isNaN(), 
            are actually methods of the global object, which in a browser environment makes them methods of the window object.

        <h2>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs</h2>
        <p><strong>The Web Storage API (HTML5 Web Storage)</strong> provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using 
            cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information 
            about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions. Rather than using the 
            getItem() and setItem() methods, assignment can be used instead.<br>
            <strong>The Geolocation API</strong> is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the 
            user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can then be used 
            to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel.<br>
            <strong>Media API</strong> is used for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript. An audio clip can be inserted into a 
            page with the <audio> tag, using the src attribute to point to the audio file. A video clip can be inserted with the <video> tag, using 
            the src attribute to point to the movie file. Any content inside the <audio> or <video> tags will only display if the browser does not 
            support them; hence, it can be used to display a message to users of older browsers without support for these features. The controls 
            attribute can be added (without any value) and will display the browser’s native controls, such as play, pause, and volume control.

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Is the OK or Cancel options automatically built in the window.confirm() method?</li>
            <li>If the methods (window.alert(), window.prompt(), window.confirm()) aren’t reliable, what’s a more reliable approach?</li>
            <li>Why is the use of document.write() frowned upon? If we encourage the use of JavaScript in our websites (for better performance and efficiency), I would assume that this method should be a good addition.</li>
            <li>How long does a local storage store data for? Basically, I think about it like Cookies. I know with Local Storage you can close out of a browser and reopen to still get access to what was stored. But where does it end? Is it until you remove it?</li>
            <li>Is it best practice to use assignments with local storage instead of getItem() and setItem()?</li>
            <li>Isn’t the Geolocation API violating privacy?</li>
        </ul>
