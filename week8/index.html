        <h2>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>
        <p>With CSS3, without a line of JavaScript or a single JPEG, we can tilt, scale, move, and even flip elements with ease. 
            The CSS3 transform property lets us translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. Translation functions 
            allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. When you employ a translation function, you’re moving elements 
            without impacting the flow of the document. Transitions animate elements over time; however, they’re limited in what they 
            can do. You can define starting and ending states, but there’s no fine-grained control over any intermediate states. CSS 
            animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.

        <h2>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
        <p>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. This can improve the performance of our 
            websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, 
            gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video. SVG stands for 
            Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. A major selling point 
            of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their 
            quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down. The Drag and Drop API  allows us to specify that certain elements are 
            draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements 
            on the page.

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Can we use drag and drop for file attachment? Or is file attachments always drag and drop enabled?</li>
            <li>Is creating CSS Animations dependent on the type of browser? Are there different requirements for different browsers?</li>
            <li>Going along with the concept of Canvas, can we make a paint palette using CSS3? </li>
