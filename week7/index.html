        <h2>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions are first-class objects which means they can have methods and properties. Eg. all functions have a length 
            property that returns the number of parameters the function has. All functions have call() and apply() methods that 
            can invoke a function with the value of this bound to an object that is provided as an argument. A recursive function 
            will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Chapter 13: Ajax</h2>
        <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web 
            pages without reloading. The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers. 
            A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request 
            and sends back a response to the client. Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs. Ajax requests can be made 
            using the Fetch API.

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I still do not understand the concept of functions defining and rewriting themselves.</li>
            <li>2. Since callbacks can get messy, is it advisable to keep using it?</li>
            <li>From the reading, it said, APIs is often serialized as JSON. Are there any other formats?</li>
